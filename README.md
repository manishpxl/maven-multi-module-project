# 🧩 Maven Multi-Module Project

A simple **Maven multi-module Java project** that demonstrates how to manage multiple modules under a single parent using a shared `pom.xml`. 🚀  

This setup helps organize large applications into smaller, manageable parts — each module can be built, tested, and maintained independently while sharing configurations and dependencies.
